# ComfyUI-TRELLIS2

## Installation

Three options, in order of speed → reliability:

1. **ComfyUI Manager (recommended)** — search for `TRELLIS2` in the Manager and click Install from the highest version displayed. If that doesn't work, try nightly.
2. **Manager via Git URL** — in ComfyUI Manager: "Install via Git URL" with `https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-TRELLIS2.git`.
3. **Manual (most reliable)**:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   git clone https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-TRELLIS2.git
   cd ComfyUI-TRELLIS2
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   python install.py
   ```
